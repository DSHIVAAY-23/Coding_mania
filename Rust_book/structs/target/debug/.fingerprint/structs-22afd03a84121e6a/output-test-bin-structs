{"message":"ambiguous associated type","code":{"code":"E0223","explanation":"An attempt was made to retrieve an associated type, but the type was ambiguous.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0223\ntrait Trait { type X; }\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo: Trait::X;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem here is that we're attempting to take the associated type of `X`\nfrom `Trait`. Unfortunately, the type of `X` is not defined, because it's only\nmade concrete in implementations of the trait.
