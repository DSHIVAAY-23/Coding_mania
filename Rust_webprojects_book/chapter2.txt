Important notes
To share states between
threads, you can use the web::Data provided by Actix. The shared state wrapped inside web::Data must be shareable between threads. Luckily,
Handlebars is Send + Sync, so it can be used in web::Data. We call the
web::Data::new() function and pass the Handlebars instance to it.   -------page 25
